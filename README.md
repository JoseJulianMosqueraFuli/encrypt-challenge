# Text Encryption Web Tool

This is a simple web-based tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using a specific encryption algorithm. It provides an easy-to-use interface where you can enter your text, choose an encryption algorithm, and then encrypt or decrypt the text accordingly.

## Features

- Text encryption using a specified encryption algorithm
- Text decryption using the same encryption algorithm
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions
- Real-time feedback on the encrypted/decrypted text
- Copy to clipboard functionality for easy sharing of results

## Supported Encryption Algorithms

The following encryption algorithms are supported in this web tool:

- Algorithm 1:
  - The encryption "keys" we will be using are as follows:
    - The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
    - The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
    - The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
    - The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
    - The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

## Getting Started

To use this text encryption web tool, follow these steps:

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the provided input field.
2. Choose the encryption algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button depending on the action you want to perform.
4. The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed in the output field.
5. You can click the "Copy" button to copy the result to the clipboard for easy sharing.

## Development

This web tool is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The encryption algorithms are implemented in JavaScript. You can customize the design, functionality, and encryption algorithms according to your requirements.

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to test the tool.
3. Modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed.
